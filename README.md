**Brief**

You have been asked to create an app that will allow a music collector to manage their collection of CDs/records.

In their console they would like to be able to:

- Create and Save Artists
- Create and Save Albums
- List All Artists/Albums
- List all the albums by an artist
- Get the artist for a particular album
- Every artist should have a name, and each album should have a name/title, genre and artist ID.

**Extensions**

- Edit Artists/Albums
- Delete Artists/Albums
- Find Artists/Albums by their ID
